* Assumption
1. Used Amazon as another selling/reselling portal.
2. Multiple pages are scraped from Amazon.
3. More dates can be scraped on Amazon if the keywords are related to software/games (e.g. "microsoft office home").
4. Do not try short keywords. Otherwise there will be too many items scraped.
5. The prices are in USD.
6. If a range of price is given in Amazon, the lower price is scraped.
7. Items from Craigslist and Amazon are both involved in the determination of average and lowest selling price.
8. If the date for an item is not shown on Amazon's search result page, we assume that there are no dates for that item.
9. For task 3, the scraping multiple pages messages are printed on the console using System.out.println().
